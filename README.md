got regex for mileage helper from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2901102/how-to-print-a-number-with-commas-as-thousands-separators-in-javascript

User stories:
As a user I want to log in and see my vehicles.  Want to be able to create one

Want to see vehicle mileage, make model year, then maintenance data like last oil change, last valve clearance check, etc etc, by creating new fields with name of work, date and mileage.

Nice to have: want to be able to import images. Pics for my vehicles, and also a pic of the maintenance sheet for reference

many more nice to haves:

also log "next oil change at:" etc. With a target mileage and date
then if user logs current mileage above any 'next maintenance' or if they date goes by a message will pop up

As user, want to catalog any work I paid for. if oil change cost $20 that's easy. But more often, several things will be billed together.
as user want to catalog what brand + part I used. No more wondering which oil filter I put in

Have some work stuff seeded for potential columns like oil change and valves,
so that as a user I don't need to create all this boilerplate for all of my vehicles.
